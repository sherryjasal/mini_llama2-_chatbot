# mini_llama2-🦙_chatbot
This chatbot is created for practice purpose using Meta's Llama2 following few tutorials.

In this project, we are using llama2-7B🦙

Why llama2 ?!

🦙llama2 is a large language model by Meta easily and freely available to use for reasearch and commercial purpose.
🦙it has longer context lengths of size 4096.
🦙it is available in 3 sizes: 7B, 13B and 70B
🦙llama2 is trained on the data twice the size of the data used in version 1 almost around 2 trillion tokens
🦙training included human annotations and fine-tuning for chat comp;etions
🦙outperforms other open source LLMs in benchmarks for reasoning, coding profeciency and knowledge base.

While it's freely available to use and download but to run llama 2 on self-hosted platform but it reuqires expensive GPUs.
Alternatively, we can a cloud platform like Streamlit and use LLM via API calls.

In this project, we are building llama2 chatbot using Streamlit for frontend while backend is managed using API calls to the llama2 hosted on Replicate.

In this practice tutorial, we will be learning:
- Getting Replicate API token from 
- Setting up coding environment
- Building the app
- Setting the API token
- Deploying the app
